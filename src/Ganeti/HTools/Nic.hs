{-| Module describing an NIC.

The NIC data type only holds data about a NIC, but does not provide any
logic.

-- | The NIC type.
--
-- It holds the data for a NIC as it is provided via the IAllocator protocol
-- for an instance creation request. All data in those request is optional,
-- that's why all fields are Maybe's.
--
-- TODO: Another name might be more appropriate for this type, as for example
-- RequestedNic. But this type is used as a field in the Instance type, which
-- is not named RequestedInstance, so such a name would be weird. PartialNic
-- already exists in Objects, but doesn't fit the bill here, as it contains
-- a required field (mac). Objects and the types therein are subject to being
-- reworked, so until then this type is left as is.
