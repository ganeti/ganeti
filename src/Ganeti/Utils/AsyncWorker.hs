{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}

{-| Provides a general functionality for workers that run on the background
and perform some task when triggered.

Each task can process multiple triggers, if they're coming faster than the
tasks are being processed.

Properties:

- If a worked is triggered, it will perform its action eventually.
  (i.e. it won't miss a trigger).

- If the worker is busy, the new action will start immediately when it finishes
  the current one.

- If the worker is idle, it'll start the action immediately.

- If the caller uses 'triggerAndWait', the call will return just after the
  earliest action following the trigger is finished.

- If the caller uses 'triggerWithResult', it will recive an 'Async' value that
  can be used to wait for the result (which will be available once the earliest
  action following the trigger finishes).

- If the worker finishes an action and there are no pending triggers since the
  start of the last action, it becomes idle and waits for a new trigger.
