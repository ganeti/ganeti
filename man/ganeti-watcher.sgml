    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      The <command>&dhpackage;</command> is a periodically run script
      which is responsible for keeping the instances in the correct
      status.
    </para>

    <para>
      Its function is to try to keep running all instances which are
      marked as <emphasis>up</emphasis> in the configuration file, by
      trying to start them a limited number of times.
    </para>

    <para>In order to prevent piling up commands, all the
    <emphasis>gnt-*</emphasis> commands executed by ganeti-watcher are
    run with a timeout of 15 seconds.
    </para>

    <para>
      The command has a state file located at
      <filename>@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/restart_state</filename> and a log
      file at
      <filename>@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/watcher.log</filename>. Removal of
      either file will not affect correct operation; the removal of
      the state file will just cause the restart counters for the
      instances to reset to zero.
    </para>

    <title>KNOWN BUGS</title>

    <para>
      Due to the way we initialize DRBD peers, restarting a secondary
      node for an instance will cause the DRBD endpoints on that node
      to disappear, thus all instances which have that node as a
      secondary will lose redundancy. The watcher does not detect this
      situation. The workaround is to manually run
      <command>gnt-instance activate-disks</command> for all the
      affected instances.
    </para>
