    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      The <command>&dhpackage;</command> is the daemon which is
      responsible for the overall cluster coordination. Without it, no
      change can be performed on the cluster.
    </para>

    <para>
      For testing purposes, you can give the <option>-f</option>
      option and the program won't detach from the running terminal.
    </para>

    <para>
      Debug-level message can be activated by giving the
      <option>-d</option> option.
    </para>
    <refsect2>
      <title>ROLE</title>
      <para>
        The role of the master daemon is to coordinate all the actions
        that change the state of the cluster. Things like accepting
        new jobs, coordinating the changes on nodes (via RPC calls to
        the respective node daemons), maintaining the configuration
        and so on are done via this daemon.
      </para>

      <para>
        The only action that can be done without the master daemon is
        the failover of the master role to another node in the
        cluster, via the <command>gnt-cluster
        master-failover</command> command.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the master daemon is stopped, the instances are not
        affected, but they won't be restarted automatically in case of
        failure.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>STARTUP</title>
      <para>
        At startup, the master daemon will confirm with the node
        daemons that the node it is running is indeed the master node
        of the cluster. It will abort if it doesn't get half plus one
        positive answers (offline nodes are queried too, just in case
        our configuration is stale).
      </para>

      <para>
        For small clusters with a number of nodes down, and especially
        for two-node clusters where the other has gone done, this
        creates a problem. In this case the
        <option>--no-voting</option> option can be used to skip this
        process. The option requires interactive confirmation, as
        having two masters on the same cluster is a very dangerous
        situation and will most likely lead to data loss.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>JOB QUEUE</title>
      <para>
        The master daemon maintains a job queue (located under
        <filename
        class="directory">@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/queue</filename>) in
        which all current jobs are stored, one job per file serialized
        in JSON format; in this directory a subdirectory called
        <filename class="directory">archive</filename> holds archived
        job files.
      </para>

      <para>
        The moving of jobs from the current to the queue directory is
        done via a request to the master; this can be accomplished
        from the command line with the <command>gnt-job
        archive</command> or <command>gnt-job autoarchive</command>
        commands. In case of problems with the master, a job file can
        simply be moved away or deleted (but this might leave the
        cluster inconsistent).
      </para>

    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL</title>
      <para>
        The master accepts commands over a Unix socket, using JSON
        serialized messages separated by a specific byte sequence. For
        more details, see the design documentation supplied with
        Ganeti.
      </para>
    </refsect2>
