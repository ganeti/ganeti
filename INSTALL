Ganeti quick installation guide
===============================

Please note that a more detailed installation procedure is described in
the :doc:`install`. A glossary of terms can be found in the
:doc:`glossary`.


Software Requirements
---------------------

Before installing, please verify that you have the following programs:

- `Xen Hypervisor <http://www.xen.org/>`_, version 3.0 or above, if
  running on Xen
- `KVM Hypervisor <http://www.linux-kvm.org>`_, version 72 or above, if
  running on KVM. In order to use advanced features, such as live
  migration, virtio, etc, an even newer version is recommended (qemu-kvm
  versions 0.11.X or above have shown good behavior).
- `DRBD <http://www.drbd.org/>`_, kernel module and userspace utils,
  version 8.0.7 or above
- `LVM2 <http://sourceware.org/lvm2/>`_
- `OpenSSH <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>`_
- `bridge utilities <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:Bridge>`_

- `arping <http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/>`_ (part of iputils)
- `ndisc6 <http://www.remlab.net/ndisc6/>`_ (if using IPv6)
- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_, version 2.4 or above, not 3.0
- `Python OpenSSL bindings <http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `simplejson Python module <http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/>`_
- `pyparsing Python module <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_, version
  1.4.6 or above
- `pyinotify Python module <http://trac.dbzteam.org/pyinotify/>`_
- `PycURL Python module <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `ctypes Python module
  <http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/>`_, if running on
  python 2.4 (optional, used for node daemon memory locking)
- `socat <http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/>`_, see :ref:`note
  <socat-note>` below
- `Paramiko <http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>`_, if you want automated SSH
  setup; optional otherwise but manual setup of the nodes required
- `affinity Python module <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/affinity/0.1.0>`_,
  optional python package for supporting CPU pinning under KVM
- `ElementTree Python module <http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm>`_,
  if running python 2.4 (optional, used by ovfconverter tool)
- `qemu-img <http://qemu.org/>`_, if you want to use ovfconverter

These programs are supplied as part of most Linux distributions, so
usually they can be installed via the standard package manager. Also
many of them will already be installed on a standard machine. On
Debian/Ubuntu, you can use this command line to install all required
packages, except for DRBD and Xen::

  $ apt-get install lvm2 ssh bridge-utils iproute iputils-arping \
                    ndisc6 python python-pyopenssl openssl \
                    python-pyparsing python-simplejson \
                    python-pyinotify python-pycurl socat \
                    python-elementtree qemu

If you want to also enable the `htools` components, which is recommended
on bigger deployments (they give you automatic instance placement,
cluster balancing, etc.), then you need to have a Haskell compiler
installed. More specifically:

- `GHC <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/>`_ version 6.10 or higher
- or even better, `The Haskell Platform
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>`_ which gives you a simple way
  to bootstrap Haskell
- `json <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json>`_, a JSON library
- `network <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network>`_, a basic
  network library
- `parallel <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parallel>`_, a parallel
  programming library (note: tested with up to version 3.x)
- `curl <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/curl>`_, bindings for the
  curl library, only needed if you want these tools to connect to remote
  clusters (as opposed to the local one)

All of these are also available as package in Debian/Ubuntu::

  $ apt-get install ghc6 libghc6-json-dev libghc6-network-dev \
                    libghc6-parallel-dev libghc6-curl-dev

Note that more recent version have switched to GHC 7.x and the packages
were renamed::

  $ apt-get install ghc libghc-json-dev libghc-network-dev \
                    libghc-parallel-dev libghc-curl-dev

The compilation of the htools components is automatically enabled when
the compiler and the requisite libraries are found. You can use the
``--enable-htools`` configure flag to force the selection (at which
point ``./configure`` will fail if it doesn't find the prerequisites).

If you want to build from source, please see doc/devnotes.rst for more
dependencies.

.. _socat-note:
.. note::
  Ganeti's import/export functionality uses ``socat`` with OpenSSL for
  transferring data between nodes. By default, OpenSSL 0.9.8 and above
  employ transparent compression of all data using zlib if supported by
  both sides of a connection. In cases where a lot of data is
  transferred, this can lead to an increased CPU usage. Additionally,
  Ganeti already compresses all data using ``gzip`` where it makes sense
  (for inter-cluster instance moves).

  To remedey this situation, patches implementing a new ``socat`` option
  for disabling OpenSSL compression have been contributed and will
  likely be included in the next feature release. Until then, users or
  distributions need to apply the patches on their own.

  Ganeti will use the option if it's detected by the ``configure``
  script; auto-detection can be disabled by explicitely passing
  ``--enable-socat-compress`` (use the option to disable compression) or
  ``--disable-socat-compress`` (don't use the option).

  The patches and more information can be found on
  http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/contrib/socat-opensslcompress.html.


Installation of the software
----------------------------

To install, simply run the following command::

  ./configure --localstatedir=/var --sysconfdir=/etc && \
  make && \
  make install

This will install the software under ``/usr/local``. You then need to
copy ``doc/examples/ganeti.initd`` to ``/etc/init.d/ganeti`` and
integrate it into your boot sequence (``chkconfig``, ``update-rc.d``,
etc.).


Cluster initialisation
----------------------

Before initialising the cluster, on each node you need to create the
following directories:

- ``/etc/ganeti``
- ``/var/lib/ganeti``
- ``/var/log/ganeti``
- ``/srv/ganeti``
- ``/srv/ganeti/os``
- ``/srv/ganeti/export``

After this, use ``gnt-cluster init``.
