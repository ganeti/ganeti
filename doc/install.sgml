    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      Ganeti is a cluster virtualization management system based on
      Xen. This document explains how to bootstrap a Ganeti node (Xen
      <literal>dom0</literal>), create a running cluster and install
      virtual instance (Xen <literal>domU</literal>).  You need to
      repeat most of the steps in this document for every node you
      want to install, but of course we recommend creating some
      semi-automatic procedure if you plan to deploy Ganeti on a
      medium/large scale.
    </para>

    <para>
      A basic Ganeti terminology glossary is provided in the
      introductory section of the <emphasis>Ganeti administrator's
      guide</emphasis>. Please refer to that document if you are
      uncertain about the terms we are using.
    </para>

    <para>
      Ganeti has been developed for Linux and is
      distribution-agnostic.  This documentation will use Debian Etch
      as an example system but the examples can easily be translated
      to any other distribution.  You are expected to be familiar with
      your distribution, its package management system, and Xen before
      trying to use Ganeti.
    </para>

    <para>This document is divided into two main sections:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Installation of the base system and base
            components</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Configuration of the environment for
            Ganeti</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      Each of these is divided into sub-sections. While a full Ganeti system
      will need all of the steps specified, some are not strictly required for
      every environment. Which ones they are, and why, is specified in the
      corresponding sections.

      <title>Hardware requirements</title>

      <para>
        Any system supported by your Linux distribution is fine.  64-bit
        systems are better as they can support more memory.
      </para>

      <para>
        Any disk drive recognized by Linux
        (<literal>IDE</literal>/<literal>SCSI</literal>/<literal>SATA</literal>/etc.)
        is supported in Ganeti. Note that no shared storage (e.g.
        <literal>SAN</literal>) is needed to get high-availability features. It
        is highly recommended to use more than one disk drive to improve speed.
        But Ganeti also works with one disk per machine.
      </para>

      <title>Installing the base system</title>

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Mandatory</emphasis> on all nodes.
      </para>

      <para>
        It is advised to start with a clean, minimal install of the
        operating system. The only requirement you need to be aware of
        at this stage is to partition leaving enough space for a big
        (<emphasis role="strong">minimum
        <constant>20GiB</constant></emphasis>) LVM volume group which
        will then host your instance filesystems. The volume group
        name Ganeti 1.2 uses (by default) is
        <emphasis>xenvg</emphasis>.
      </para>

      <para>
        While you can use an existing system, please note that the
        Ganeti installation is intrusive in terms of changes to the
        system configuration, and it's best to use a newly-installed
        system without important data on it.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, for best results, it's advised that the nodes have as
        much as possible the same hardware and software
        configuration. This will make administration much easier.
      </para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Hostname issues</title>
        <para>
          Note that Ganeti requires the hostnames of the systems
          (i.e. what the <computeroutput>hostname</computeroutput>
          command outputs to be a fully-qualified name, not a short
          name. In other words, you should use
          <literal>node1.example.com</literal> as a hostname and not
          just <literal>node1</literal>.
        </para>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Debian</title>
          <para>
            Note that Debian Etch configures the hostname differently
            than you need it for Ganeti. For example, this is what
            Etch puts in <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> in certain
            situations:
<screen>
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       node1.example.com node1
</screen>

          but for Ganeti you need to have:
<screen>
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.1     node1.example.com node1
</screen>
            replacing <literal>192.168.1.1</literal> with your node's
            address. Also, the file <filename>/etc/hostname</filename>
            which configures the hostname of the system should contain
            <literal>node1.example.com</literal> and not just
            <literal>node1</literal> (you need to run the command
            <computeroutput>/etc/init.d/hostname.sh
            start</computeroutput> after changing the file).
          </para>

      <title>Installing Xen</title>

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Mandatory</emphasis> on all nodes.
      </para>

      <para>
        While Ganeti is developed with the ability to modularly run on
        different virtualization environments in mind the only one
        currently useable on a live system is <ulink
        url="http://xen.xensource.com/">Xen</ulink>. Supported
        versions are: <simplelist type="inline">
        <member><literal>3.0.3</literal></member>
        <member><literal>3.0.4</literal></member>
        <member><literal>3.1</literal></member> </simplelist>.
      </para>

      <para>
        Please follow your distribution's recommended way to install
        and set up Xen, or install Xen from the upstream source, if
        you wish, following their manual.
      </para>

      <para>
        After installing Xen you need to reboot into your Xen-ified
        dom0 system. On some distributions this might involve
        configuring GRUB appropriately, whereas others will configure
        it automatically when you install Xen from a package.
      </para>

      <formalpara><title>Debian</title>
      <para>
        Under Debian Etch or Sarge+backports you can install the
        relevant <literal>xen-linux-system</literal> package, which
        will pull in both the hypervisor and the relevant
        kernel. Also, if you are installing a 32-bit Etch, you should
        install the <computeroutput>libc6-xen</computeroutput> package
        (run <computeroutput>apt-get install
        libc6-xen</computeroutput>).
      </para>
      </formalpara>

      <sect3>
        <title>Xen settings</title>

        <para>
          It's recommended that dom0 is restricted to a low amount of
          memory (<constant>512MiB</constant> is reasonable) and that
          memory ballooning is disabled in the file
          <filename>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</filename> by setting the
          value <literal>dom0-min-mem</literal> to
          <constant>0</constant>, like this:
          <computeroutput>(dom0-min-mem 0)</computeroutput>
        </para>

        <para>
          For optimum performance when running both CPU and I/O
          intensive instances, it's also recommended that the dom0 is
          restricted to one CPU only, for example by booting with the
          kernel parameter <literal>nosmp</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
          It is recommended that you disable xen's automatic save of virtual
          machines at system shutdown and subsequent restore of them at reboot.
          To obtain this make sure the variable
          <literal>XENDOMAINS_SAVE</literal> in the file
          <literal>/etc/default/xendomains</literal> is set to an empty value.
        </para>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Debian</title>
          <para>
            Besides the ballooning change which you need to set in
            <filename>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</filename>, you need to
            set the memory and nosmp parameters in the file
            <filename>/boot/grub/menu.lst</filename>. You need to
            modify the variable <literal>xenhopt</literal> to add
            <userinput>dom0_mem=512M</userinput> like this:
<screen>
## Xen hypervisor options to use with the default Xen boot option
# xenhopt=dom0_mem=512M
</screen>
            and the <literal>xenkopt</literal> needs to include the
            <userinput>nosmp</userinput> option like this:
<screen>
## Xen Linux kernel options to use with the default Xen boot option
# xenkopt=nosmp
</screen>

          Any existing parameters can be left in place: it's ok to
          have <computeroutput>xenkopt=console=tty0
          nosmp</computeroutput>, for example. After modifying the
          files, you need to run:
<screen>
/sbin/update-grub

      <sect3>
        <title>Selecting the instance kernel</title>

        <para>
          After you have installed Xen, you need to tell Ganeti
          exactly what kernel to use for the instances it will
          create. This is done by creating a
          <emphasis>symlink</emphasis> from your actual kernel to
          <filename>/boot/vmlinuz-2.6-xenU</filename>, and one from
          your initrd to
          <filename>/boot/initrd-2.6-xenU</filename>. Note that if you
          don't use an initrd for the <literal>domU</literal> kernel,
          you don't need to create the initrd symlink.
        </para>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Debian</title>
          <para>
            After installation of the
            <literal>xen-linux-system</literal> package, you need to
            run (replace the exact version number with the one you
            have):
            <screen>
cd /boot
ln -s vmlinuz-2.6.18-5-xen-686 vmlinuz-2.6-xenU
ln -s initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-686 initrd-2.6-xenU

      <title>Installing DRBD</title>

      <para>
        Recommended on all nodes: <ulink
        url="http://www.drbd.org/">DRBD</ulink> is required if you
        want to use the high availability (HA) features of Ganeti, but
        optional if you don't require HA or only run Ganeti on
        single-node clusters. You can upgrade a non-HA cluster to an
        HA one later, but you might need to export and re-import all
        your instances to take advantage of the new features.
      </para>

      <para>
        Supported DRBD versions: the <literal>0.7</literal> series
        <emphasis role="strong">or</emphasis>
        <literal>8.0.x</literal>. It's recommended to have at least
        version <literal>0.7.24</literal> if you use
        <command>udev</command> since older versions have a bug
        related to device discovery which can be triggered in cases of
        hard drive failure.
      </para>

      <para>
        Now the bad news: unless your distribution already provides it
        installing DRBD might involve recompiling your kernel or
        anyway fiddling with it. Hopefully at least the Xen-ified
        kernel source to start from will be provided.
      </para>

      <para>
        The good news is that you don't need to configure DRBD at all.
        Ganeti will do it for you for every instance you set up.  If
        you have the DRBD utils installed and the module in your
        kernel you're fine. Please check that your system is
        configured to load the module at every boot, and that it
        passes the following option to the module (for
        <literal>0.7.x</literal>:
        <computeroutput>minor_count=64</computeroutput> (this will
        allow you to use up to 32 instances per node) or for
        <literal>8.0.x</literal> you can use up to
        <constant>255</constant>
        (i.e. <computeroutput>minor_count=255</computeroutput>, but
        for most clusters <constant>128</constant> should be enough).
      </para>

      <formalpara><title>Debian</title>
        <para>
         You can just install (build) the DRBD 0.7 module with the
         following commands (make sure you are running the Xen
         kernel):
        </para>
      </formalpara>

      <screen>
apt-get install drbd0.7-module-source drbd0.7-utils
m-a update
m-a a-i drbd0.7
echo drbd minor_count=64 >> /etc/modules
modprobe drbd minor_count=64
      </screen>
      <para>or for using DRBD <literal>8.x</literal> from the etch
      backports:</para>
      <screen>
apt-get install -t etch-backports drbd8-module-source drbd8-utils
m-a update
m-a a-i drbd8
echo drbd minor_count=128 >> /etc/modules
modprobe drbd minor_count=128
      </screen>

      <para>
        It is also recommended that you comment out the default
        resources in the <filename>/etc/dbrd.conf</filename> file, so
        that the init script doesn't try to configure any drbd
        devices. You can do this by prefixing all
        <literal>resource</literal> lines in the file with the keyword
        <literal>skip</literal>, like this:
      </para>

      <screen>
skip resource r0 {
...
}

skip resource "r1" {
...
}
      </screen>

      <title>Configuring the network</title>

      <para><emphasis role="strong">Mandatory</emphasis> on all nodes.</para>

      <para>
        Ganeti relies on Xen running in "bridge mode", which means the
        instances network interfaces will be attached to a software bridge
        running in dom0. Xen by default creates such a bridge at startup, but
        your distribution might have a different way to do things.
      </para>

      <para>
        Beware that the default name Ganeti uses is
        <hardware>xen-br0</hardware> (which was used in Xen 2.0)
        while Xen 3.0 uses <hardware>xenbr0</hardware> by
        default. The default bridge your Ganeti cluster will use for new
        instances can be specified at cluster initialization time.
      </para>

      <formalpara><title>Debian</title>
        <para>
          The recommended Debian way to configure the Xen bridge is to
          edit your <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file
          and substitute your normal Ethernet stanza with the
          following snippet:

        <screen>
auto xen-br0

        To check if the bridge is setup, use <command>ip</command>

        If you haven't configured your LVM volume group at install
        time you need to do it before trying to initialize the Ganeti
        cluster. This is done by formatting the devices/partitions you
        want to use for it and then adding them to the relevant volume
        group:

       <screen>
pvcreate /dev/sda3
vgcreate xenvg /dev/sda3
       </screen>
or
       <screen>
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
pvcreate /dev/sdc1
vgcreate xenvg /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
       </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
	If you want to add a device later you can do so with the
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>vgextend</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> command:

          It is recommended to configure LVM not to scan the DRBD
          devices for physical volumes. This can be accomplished by
          editing <filename>/etc/lvm/lvm.conf</filename> and adding
          the <literal>/dev/drbd[0-9]+</literal> regular expression to
          the <literal>filter</literal> variable, like this:

    filter = [ "r|/dev/cdrom|", "r|/dev/drbd[0-9]+|" ]

      <para>The last step is to initialize the cluster. After you've repeated
        the above process on all of your nodes, choose one as the master, and execute:
      </para>

      <screen>
gnt-cluster init <replaceable>CLUSTERNAME</replaceable>
      </screen>

      <para>
        The <replaceable>CLUSTERNAME</replaceable> is a hostname,
        which must be resolvable (e.g. it must exist in DNS or in
        <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>) by all the nodes in the
        cluster. You must choose a name different from any of the
        nodes names for a multi-node cluster. In general the best
        choice is to have a unique name for a cluster, even if it
        consists of only one machine, as you will be able to expand it
        later without any problems.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the bridge name you are using is not
        <literal>xen-br0</literal>, use the <option>-b

        specify the bridge name. In this case, you should also use the

        same <replaceable>BRIDGENAME</replaceable> argument.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can use a different name than <literal>xenvg</literal> for
        the volume group (but note that the name must be identical on
        all nodes). In this case you need to specify it by passing the
        <option>-g <replaceable>VGNAME</replaceable></option> option
        to <computeroutput>gnt-cluster init</computeroutput>.

        Ganeti uses DRBD to mirror the disk of the virtual instances
        between nodes. To use a dedicated network interface for this
        (in order to improve performance or to enhance security) you
        need to configure an additional interface for each node.  Use
        the <option>-s</option> option with
        <computeroutput>gnt-cluster init</computeroutput> and
        <computeroutput>gnt-node add</computeroutput> to specify the
        IP address of this secondary interface to use for each
        node. Note that if you specified this option at cluster setup

        <computeroutput>gnt-instance console
        <literal>inst1</literal></computeroutput>. There is no
