Version 1.2.4
  - Experimental readonly, REST-based remote API implementation; automatically
    started on master node, TCP port 5080, if enabled by --enable-rapi
    parameter to configure script.

Version 1.2.3
  - more tweaks to the disk activation code (especially helpful for DRBD)
  - change the default ‘gnt-instance list’ output format, now there is
    one combined status field (see the manpage for the exact values this
    field will have)
  - some more fixes for the mac export to hooks change
  - make Ganeti not break with DRBD 8.2.x (which changed the version
    format in /proc/drbd) (issue 24)
  - add an upgrade tool from ‘remote_raid1’ disk template to ‘drbd’ disk
    template, allowing migration from DRBD0.7+MD to DRBD8

Version 1.2.2
  - fix ‘gnt-instance modify’ breakage introduced in 1.2.1 with the HVM
    support (issue 23)
  - add command aliases infrastructure and a few aliases
  - allow listing of VCPUs in the gnt-instance list and improve the man
    pages and the --help option of gnt-node/gnt-instance list
  - fix gnt-backup list with down nodes (issue 21)
  - change the tools location (move from $pkgdatadir to
    $pkglibdir/tools)
  - fix the dist archive and add a check for including svn/git files in
    the future
  - some developer-related changes: improve the burnin and the QA
    suite, add an upload script for testing during development

Version 1.2.1
  - experimental HVM support, read the install document, section
    "Initializing the cluster"
  - allow for the PVM hypervisor per-instance kernel and initrd paths
  - add a new command ‘gnt-cluster verify-disks’ which uses a new
    algorithm to improve the reconnection of the DRBD pairs if the
    device on the secondary node has gone away
  - make logical volume code auto-activate LVs at disk activation time
  - slightly improve the speed of activating disks
  - allow specification of the MAC address at instance creation time,
    and changing it later via ‘gnt-instance modify’
  - fix handling of external commands that generate lots of output on
    stderr
  - update documentation with regard to minimum version of DRBD8
    supported

Version 1.2.0
  - Log the ‘xm create’ output to the node daemon log on failure (to
    help diagnosing the error)
  - In debug mode, log all external commands output if failed to the
    logs
  - Change parsing of lvm commands to ignore stderr

Version 1.2b3
  - Another round of updates to the DRBD 8 code to deal with more
    failures in the replace secondary node operation
  - Some more logging of failures in disk operations (lvm, drbd)
  - A few documentation updates
  - QA updates

Version 1.2b2
  - Change configuration file format from Python's Pickle to JSON.
    Upgrading is possible using the cfgupgrade utility.
  - Add support for DRBD 8.0 (new disk template `drbd`) which allows for
    faster replace disks and is more stable (DRBD 8 has many
    improvements compared to DRBD 0.7)
  - Added command line tags support (see man pages for gnt-instance,
    gnt-node, gnt-cluster)
  - Added instance rename support
  - Added multi-instance startup/shutdown
  - Added cluster rename support
  - Added `gnt-node evacuate` to simplify some node operations
  - Added instance reboot operation that can speedup reboot as compared
    to stop and start
  - Soften the requirement that hostnames are in FQDN format
  - The ganeti-watcher now activates drbd pairs after secondary node
    reboots
  - Removed dependency on debian's patched fping that uses the
    non-standard -S option
  - Now the OS definitions are searched for in multiple, configurable
    paths (easier for distros to package)
  - Some changes to the hooks infrastructure (especially the new
    post-configuration update hook)
  - Other small bugfixes
