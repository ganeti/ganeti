Version 1.2b2
  - Change configuration file format from Python's Pickle to JSON.
    Upgrading is possible using the cfgupgrade utility.
  - Add support for DRBD 8.0 (new disk template `drbd`) which allows for
    faster replace disks and is more stable (DRBD 8 has many
    improvements compared to DRBD 0.7)
  - Added command line tags support (see man pages for gnt-instance,
    gnt-node, gnt-cluster)
  - Added instance rename support
  - Added multi-instance startup/shutdown
  - Added cluster rename support
  - Added `gnt-node evacuate` to simplify some node operations
  - Added instance reboot operation that can speedup reboot as compared
    to stop and start
  - Soften the requirement that hostnames are in FQDN format
  - The ganeti-watcher now activates drbd pairs after secondary node
    reboots
  - Removed dependency on debian's patched fping that uses the
    non-standard -S option
  - Now the OS definitions are searched for in multiple, configurable
    paths (easier for distros to package)
  - Some changes to the hooks infrastructure (especially the new
    post-configuration update hook)
  - Other small bugfixes
